# Rust Keyword Extraction

### Introduction

This is a simple NLP library with a list of algorithms related to keyword extraction:

- Tokenizer for tokenizing text;
- TF-IDF for calculating the importance of a word in a document;
- Co-occurrence for calculating relationships between words within a specific window size;

And more to come! This library is still in development, and is part of a blog series on [dev.to](https://dev.to/tugascript).

### Usage

This library is not yet published on crates.io, so you will have to clone this repository and add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.
